## Project Title: Number Plate Detection and Record Maintenance System

**Description:**
This project focuses on implementing a system for the automatic detection of vehicle number plates as they pass through the main gate of our college campus. The system captures images or videos of vehicles entering or exiting the campus and extracts the number plates from these images/videos using image processing techniques.

**Functionality:**

- Automatic detection of number plates from vehicle images/videos.
- Extraction of alphanumeric characters from the detected number plates.
- Maintenance of a record/database containing the date, time, and detected number plates of vehicles passing through the main gate.
- User-friendly interface for accessing and managing the recorded data.

**Purpose:**
This project is developed as part of the coursework for Image and Video Processing (EE6310). It serves as a practical application of the concepts learned in the course, demonstrating the use of image processing techniques for real-world tasks like vehicle monitoring and record-keeping.
